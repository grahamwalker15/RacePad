Autonomy is revolutionising the IT industry by delivering a software platform that
enables computers to see patterns in information the way humans do. By bringing meaning,
understanding and intelligence to information within the corporation, such as emails,
voicemails, audio and video, and beyond it, across social networking sites, blogs and
customer reviews, Autonomy provides organisations with bird’s eye view of information
and enables the automation of a raft of business processes and operations. Be it social
chatter about your brand, blog postings revealing an emerging trend within your industry,
call centre recordings about a new product line, or an email chain that poses a compliance
risk, Autonomy’s technology automatically identifies meaningful patterns in data and empowers
organisations to immediately act on the insights. Thanks to Autonomy’s unique pattern-matching
technology, organisations can now minimise corporate risk, recognise new market opportunities,
deliver better customer experiences across multi-channel entry points, turn social conversations
into profit, manage their brand reputations, and identify fraudulent or suspicious behavior all
in real time. The result is that Autonomy has become the UK’s largest software company and a
global leader in infrastructure software. With over 20,000 customers across seven continents,
Autonomy is also the fastest growing stock in the FTSE 100.
