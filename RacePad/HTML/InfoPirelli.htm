Fifth largest operator in the world in the tyre sector for sales, Pirelli is leader in
the high range segments with high technological content. Founded in 1872, there are now
20 Pirelli Tyre factories throughout the world, in four continents, operating in more than
160 countries. Pirelli is distinguished for its long industrial tradition, which has
always been combined with capacity for innovation, product quality and brand strength.
A strength which, since 2002, has also been based on the fashion and high-tech project of
PZero, the value of which has been further recognised by the Formula 1, for which Pirelli
Tyre is the exclusive supplier for the three-year term 2011-2013.
