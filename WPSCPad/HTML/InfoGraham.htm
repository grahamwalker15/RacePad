Founded in London by George Graham, the renowned 18th century clockmaker known as
the ‘Father of the Chronograph’, the Graham-London brand is part of The British Masters,
an Anglo-Swiss company based at La Chaux-de-Fonds in Neuchatel, the heart of Switzerland’s
watch making industry. Graham-London combines the best of Britain’s watch heritage with the
Swiss passion for fine engineering detail to continue the spirit and dedication to timekeeping
begun by Graham.
