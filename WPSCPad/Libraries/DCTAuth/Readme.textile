h1. DCTAuth

A library for performing authorised web requests to services using OAuth, OAuth 2.0 and basic authentiaction.

h2. Documentation

DCTAuth is "fully documented":http://danieltull.co.uk/DCTAuth/documentation/ and there is a "feed for the docset":http://danieltull.co.uk/DCTAuth/documentation/docset.atom that you can add to Xcode.
