Aabar Investments PJSC is an investment company headquartered in Abu Dhabi UAE and
listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. Aabar invests internationally in energy,
infrastructure, real estate, automotive, technology and financial services companies.
Aabar’s largest stakeholder is International Petroleum Investment Company, which in
turn is wholly owned by the Government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. A major component
of Aabar’s strategy is to invest in the world’s very best knowledge-leader
companies - such as Daimler AG - in order to facilitate technology transfer which
will assist Abu Dhabi’s ambitious domestic economic development plans. Aabar is the 
largest shareholder in Daimler AG (the parent company of Mercedes-Benz) and owns 30% of
the MERCEDES GP PETRONAS Formula One Team. At the inaugural Abu Dhabi GP in November 2009
(the first Formula One event to be held in the UAE at the purpose built Yas Island circuit),
Aabar’s Chairman, HE Khadem Al Qubaisi, awarded a Mercedes-Benz Black Series supercar to
Sebastian Vettel for winning the race. For 2010, Al Qubaisi is planning to donate a
Mercedes-Benz SLS super coupe to the winner of the second Abu Dhabi Grand Prix... a winner
who will hopefully be called either Michael Schumacher or Nico Rosberg!
